🎓 Interactive Lessons Hub

Engaging, gamified lessons designed for students who've switched off.
Traditional worksheets don't work for every learner. These lessons use mission-based learning — giving students a professional role, a purpose, and a reason to care.

🎯 The Approach
Every lesson follows the same formula:

You're not a student — you're a consultant, reporter, engineer, or investigator
There's a problem to solve — a government needs advice, a mystery needs solving
The content matters — because someone is counting on your answer

Students earn XP, unlock achievements, and level up through ranks as they work. It feels like a game. It teaches like a lesson. It sticks like a memory.

🎓 Who Is This For?

Teachers with disengaged or low-ability classes

💡 The Philosophy

"Disengagement isn't a reading problem or a writing problem — it's a relevance problem."

These lessons front-load the "why should I care?" before the content. Students discover that earthquakes affect their phones, that history shaped their streets, that writing skills get people jobs. Then they learn.
